      <li>Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world,
        I would want to learn Interior Design. When I was a kid, 
        I liked to watch a television show where interior designers helped
        families living in uncomfortable surroundings. I enjoyed seeing how
        the designer worked with the existing site given to them and
        took on the challenge to create aesthetic yet functional homes for 
        these families. The most common difficulty is the lack of space, and 
        the designer had to always be creative and clever to tackle these problems.
        However, I could imagine the sense of achivement from building a cozy home
        despite all the obstacles and seeing the families loves the new design.

      <li>Ask me About: I enjoy doing yoga as it helps me reduce body pain and
        relieve mental stress. I enjoy stretching my muscle which takes away
        my back pain and shoulder pain due to sitting in front of the screen for
        almost entire day. Doing yoga also reminds me to leave some time to slow 
        down the pace of my life and enjoy the current moment.
